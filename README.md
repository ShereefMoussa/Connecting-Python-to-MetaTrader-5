# Connecting Python to MetaTrader 5

> :warning: **Warning: I share the project to share my experience coding. not to give any investment advice and if you want to use any piece of my code, do it at your own risk.**

> :warning: **I found that Metatrader 5 can handle the processing data, backtest, visualization, and measure performance far better than Metatrader 4. So the project will be deprecated because I don't need to use any python machine-learning modules for now.**


 This project is about connecting Python to MetaTrader 5, pulling data, processing the data, and trading order execution.
